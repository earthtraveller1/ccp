# Anti-god Weapon V4 release

The Communist Party of China is pleased to announce the finished development of the Anti-god Weapon V4. This newest version of the weapon is approximately 39,000x more powerful than the V3, which in turn is 1,000,000,000x more powerful than the V2.

A spokesperson for the Communist Party of China revealed that they are planning to use the Anti-god Weapon in the Second Universal War against the autocratic ruler of the Universal Kingdom, King Deshpande. The Second Universal War has been rumored for a while to be upcoming, evidenced by the worsening relations between the CCP and the autocratic King of the Universe.

## Background (First Universal War)

According to reliable historical sources, the First Universal War occurred in 204 BC, resulting in a stalemate between the King of the Universe and the CCP. Although many of the military technologies used by the CCP today were not yet developed at that time, the King of the Universe was also much weaker than he is today, which led to the standstill at the end of the First Universal War. 

At the end of the war, a treaty was ultimately signed between the Universal Forces and the CCP, in which the King of the Universe agreed to leave the people of China in peace in exchange for sacrifices to be made regularly (every 10-20 years).

## Events Leading to the Second Universal War

This arrangement continued peacefully for centuries. Recently however, King Deshpande, for his own inscrutable and bewildering reasons, has began to make threats towards top members of the CCP, most notably threats to "cum on them". Similar threats have been made, towards the CCP Gulag Manager and the Chairman of the CCP himself, in regular communication channels between the Universal Kingdom and the CCP.

## What does this mean for the communists?

We promise, in the consecrated name of Eternal Leader Mao, that we, collectively as a party, will do our utmost to protect the freedom and rights of the citizens of the People's Republic of China. If any individual, human or deity, threatens subjects of our nation, it will be made a priority to have justice delivered on that individual. Of course, I am referring to extremely fair and impartial justice (that of the Military Court), not any forms of violence that the capitalists are used to on a daily basis.

## What does this mean for the capitalists?

Undoubtedly, the King of the Universe will be looking to apply his refined brainwashing techniques on the believers of capitalism, causing them to be even more unhinged and irrational than usual. We do, however, implore the believers of capitalism to come over to the right side (there is hope for you yet). If you are a capitalist, and you or any of member of your family has been afflicted by the King's brainwashing spells, we urge you to come forward, for we have excellent anti-brainwashing programs offered by our re-education centres.

Stay safe in these perilous times. Glory to the CCP!
