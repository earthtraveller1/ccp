# Tensions rise between the CCP and the Universal Forces

## Transcript of Official CCP Broadcast

Due to what we perceived as an act of aggression committed by the King of the Universe, resulting in the Chairman's executive power being removed in The Imperial City (the communication channel between the CCP and the Universal Forces), the CCP no longer recognizes the legitimacy of the Universal Kingdom.

Henceforth, the King of the Universe will now be referred to as "Random Guy of the Universe" in official CCP broadcasts. 

All diplomatic relations to the Universal Forces will now cease.

## Background

The King of the Universe, in his infinitesimal wisdom, declared one Friday evening that he will no longer recognize the authority of the Communist Party of China, despite its many contributions to global culture, science, and prosperity. 

This move by the King of the Universe seems to have been due to what was a completely normal conversation between the Chairman and the King of the Universe, to which the King suddenly took offence, seemingly for no reason apart from his crumbling sanity.

Around the world, many political commentators and word leaders, including capitalist ones, were surprised by this move, especially considering the recent development of the Anti-god Weapon V4, giving the CCP a considerable edge against the King of the Universe.

## What's going to happen now?

Undoubtedly, this latest development will contribute to the rising tensions between the CCP and the Universal Forces.

If this results in the Second Universal War, many observer nations feel that this time, the CCP will have a great advantage. Several formerly capitalist nations, including the Great Britain and France, have expressed their willingness for peace with the CCP, as shooked as they are by the newest CCP military technology.

The United States of America, on the other hand, have continued to foolishly stand behind the King of the Universe, as cowardly as they are. The Chairman, however, has stated that they will all be treated with mercy if they do not attempt to act violently, as he accepts that most of them have been subjected by unhealthy amounts of brainwashing by the King of the Universe. 

## Conclusion

As always, this article was not one of biased or politically-inflamed nature. This article was intended for citizens of the world to become familiar with the status quo, and hopefully do not come to make foolish and uninformed decisions.

Normally, we would express our support for the CCP in the face of crisis, but it seems that in this situation it is wholly unnecessary, due to the strength of the CCP and the senility of the King of the Universe.

Thank you, and glory to the vanquishment of evil!
